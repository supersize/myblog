#### **Thanks for visiting!**
**Jae's blog** is a blog website that I made for posting things I study or know about problems I faced while working or studying. This will be my new challenge to broad my outlook of IT as well as improve tech skills and trouble-shooting abilities. I really hope my recordings will help you of difficulties you have same as mine.
